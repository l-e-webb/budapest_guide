# Budapest Guide

This simple app was developed as the 6th project of Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree program.  It highlights some of the landmarks and attractions of the city of Budapest.  The color scheme is based on the Hungarian flag.  Photographs not credited below were taken by me, during a semester I spent in Budapest when I was in college.
